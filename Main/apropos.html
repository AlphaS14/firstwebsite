    <h1>Modern living in symbiosis with our environment.</h1>

    <p>My aim is to build a bridge between the physical and the digital, the speculative and the tangible—while creating better solutions for our environment and respecting our planet’s boundaries.
Shaping the physical and virtual worlds we move in is a political act and entails responsibility, not only towards society, but also the planet and its non-human inhabitants.
I want to be part of a team that acts on this responsibility and aims to contribute to a more sustainable, more socially equal society.</p>
